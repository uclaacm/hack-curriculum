# Hack Curriculum

Welcome! We are ACM Hack, a student org dedicated to creating beginner friendly software development workshops and exposing people of non-traditional tech backgrounds to CS! We put on a lot of workshop series. 

Some of our essentials:
- Hackschool: Beginner friendly web development series focusing on frontend
- Stackschool: Full stack web development series focusing on backend
- Hack Sprint: Beginner friendly mobile development series (historically we have covered React Native, iOS, and Android)
- Hack Cloud: Cloud computing series covering AWS fundamentals and general cloud computing concepts
- Tooling Series: Covering tools such as git and vim that aid in software development
- ... And more!

<!-- the idea is to completely flesh out the curriculum over winter break instead of just doing the super general layout like usual. it would be a lot of work so i’m willing to take on the majority of it and interns can help out if they want. then people who are teaching will use the fleshed out curriculum (right now i’m thinking it would be a bunch of readmes in the style of our old workshops) to make slides and hopefully personalize the workshop to their style but still keeping all the content in the curriculum. my main reason for suggesting this is the conversation we had at the end of fall quarter about workshop burnout, I think it would take a lot of the burden off officers who are teaching during the quarter bc hopefully it’s easier to make slides based on existing content. we could also just go all out and make slides too but i’m hesitant to do that bc I want to leave room for officers to grow etc. if it goes well the goal would be to eventually have a curriculum repo for all our workshop series that we update incrementally each year rather than reinvent.

but yea main benefits I think would be 
1) reducing officer burnout 
2) more consistent workshops 
3) more time for planning = higher quality (hopefully)
4) moves us towards a new infrastructure for workshops that reduces the workload significantly  -->
