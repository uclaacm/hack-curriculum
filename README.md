## Development Set Up
The curriculum website involves both a frontend (in `/website`) and a backend (in `/content`). In order to get up and running, you need to first install the necessary dependencies in each. 

To install the necessary dependencies you can run the following commands (starting from the root of the project):

```sh
$ cd website
$ npm install # installs the dependencies on the frontend
$ cd ../content
$ npm install # installs the dependencies on the backend
$ cd .. # return to root
```

Once you've done this, you can start the app by running `./start` in the root directory!
