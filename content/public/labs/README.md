topics that are usually better learnt in a hands on approach will be labs. either guided problems or interactive programs (think learning labs from TeachLA)

ideas
- navigating the terminal
- html lab
- css labs
    - properties and selectors
    - layout 
    - responsive design
- programming basics lab
- DOM

actually on second thought the guided problems should be built into the modules and only interactive programs should be considered labs. by guided problem i mean problems that are meant to be easy and step by step to solidify understanding. we can include exercises too (tougher problems, usually require lateral thinking).
