some topics are important to multiple workshop series. we should have a single canon source for each topic to reduce redundancy. modules should be general and self contained (submodules?)

links
- documentation
- slides
- video 

should provide recommendations to director for each module:
- important idea: not every topic is best learned through a workshop, some are better learned hands on (labs, contests?)
- prereqs 
- prereq graph
- slide guidelines

approaches to add mobile topics?
- idea: make modules in different flavors
    - programming basics has a flavor in js/ts/swift/kotlin
    - one flavor to start but should be easily adaptable
- idea: taxonomy
    - frontend
        - web
        - mobile
    - backend
    - programming languages
    - tooling
- should there be redundancy between mobile and web? (react vs react native)
- how to avoid it w/ module system? there are small differences between them

topic centric \
pros
- focused more on concepts rather than technologies
- technologies change
- lots of similar ideas involved in building in app in vanilla web, react, react native, iOS
