# HackCloud 

## Welcome to HackCloud 
Cloud computing is a huge and impactful part of our day-to-day livesâ€”whether it is through the use of personal clouds like Google Drive or OneDrive, or though businesses who use the cloud for computing, storage, data analytics, and more. As a result, it can seem like a very daunting task to uncover what exactly cloud computing is and how to use it. 

Through HackCloud, we hope to break down these initial barriers and bridge these gaps by introducing cloud computing and its different services in the most beginner-friendly, hands-on, interactive way possible. Thoughout this quarter, we'll be hosting weekly workshop sessions designed to build a strong intuition for cloud computing fundamentals and best practices. Complementing the theory, each workshop will feature practical and thorough hands-on demos with AWS.

In this repository, you will find guides for each session we have taught this quarter, as well as some links to helpful resources.

We hope all of you have a great time learning this quarter! Feel free to reach out to any of us at Hack if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

## What You'll Need for the Entire Course

* A text editor. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as
  a default choice. If you already use
  another editor, that's perfectly fine. Don't worry about using the "best"
  one; any modern editor is more than enough for what we'll tackle this
  quarter.

* Google Chrome: it has the best developer tools and the highest market share of
  any web browser.
  
* Amazon Web Services account: You'll need an account with AWS to follow to try
  out our weekly demos for yourself. [Creating an account](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/)
  takes <5 mins. You'll need to enter payment details, but everything we'll cover 
  will fall well within the free tier.
  
* Bonus item (if you have time): Create a GitHub account

### Helpful Docs

With cloud computing being such a broad field, it can be a bit overwhelming ot know where to start. Lucky for you, you're in the right place! Focus on the basics and building a strong intutition for why cloud systems are designed the way they are, then get some hands on experience! If you're looking to show off your skills, or want a more structured learning format try prepping for one of AWS's certifications.
